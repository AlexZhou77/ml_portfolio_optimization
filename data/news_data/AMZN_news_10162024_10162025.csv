Global annual small satellites installations reached 2,372 units in 2024 and are expected to reach 2,838 units in 2030, with a growth rate of 3.0% Miniaturized satellites having a wet mass of under 1,200 kilograms are considered under the small satellites category. The weight of the small satellites varies as per the components and sensors installed in them. These satellites have a shorter development team and cycles; thus, they can be developed and launched at a lower cost than traditional large satellites. Developments in computational technology and data analytics drove the miniaturization of satellite systems. This affordability and adaptability are fueling innovation across various sectors. The newfound affordability and agility are driving a wave of innovation across numerous applications. Small satellites are being deployed for Earth observation, gathering high-resolution imagery for environmental monitoring and resource management. They are also facilitating global communication by forming constellations that deliver internet access to previously underserved regions. The small satellite market represents a dynamic and rapidly growing segment poised to reshape the space industry. Market Drivers The number of small satellites launched in the past few years has increased significantly due to their low cost, easier integration with launch vehicles, and technological advancements. SpaceX plans to launch about 12,000 satellites in the Starlink constellation, while Amazon is investing over US$ 10 billion to launch Kuiper. The plan is to send 3,232 satellites into Low Earth Orbit (LEO) by 2029. According to the FCC's license, half is expected to be deployed by mid-2026. The small satellites market plunged in 2016 mainly due to launch failures. It further dropped slightly in 2018 when compared to 2017, owing to the decline in the number of small satellite launches. However, the market witnessed a robust pace in 2020 especially due to the launch of the Starlink internet satellite by SpaceX. Recent Market JVs and Acquisitions: A huge number of strategic alliances including M&As, JVs, etc. have been performed over the past few years: In August 2023, Planet Labs acquired Sinergise, including Sentinel Hub, to accelerate the advancement of its Earth Data Platform and the delivery of Earth Observation (EO) data to customers. This acquisition also reflected Planet Labs' eagerness to invest in Europe and develop EO data applications. In August 2021, SpaceX acquired Swarm Technologies, a company that manufactures and operates ultra-small satellites for IoT devices. Swarm's services will benefit from better capitalization and access to resources available to SpaceX. Key Players The market is highly fragmented with the presence of some players. Most of the major players compete in some of the governing factors including technology, purpose, offerings, etc. The following are the key players in the small satellite market: Here is the list of the Top Players (Based on Dominance)",GlobeNewsWire,"Thu, 09 Jan 2025 06:16:00 -0500",['PressRelease'],Neutral,Article,['AMZN']

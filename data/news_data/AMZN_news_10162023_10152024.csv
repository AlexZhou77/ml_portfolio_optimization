Momcozy's best-selling M5 Breast Pump was the single top seller in Amazon's Electric Breast Pump category, followed by the S12 Pro Wearable Breast Pump as the category's second-highest seller, the Mobile Flow M9 Hands-Free Breast Pump in third, and the M6 Hands-Free Breast Pump in fourth. In total, Momcozy's products accounted for each of the top five and nine of the top 15 Prime Day best-sellers in Amazon's Electric Breast Pump category, solidifying the brand's leading global position as a trusted source and smart option for over 4 million moms around the world. The brand's 2-in-1 Warming Lactation Massager was the hottest Prime Day seller across Amazon's Lactation Massager category, and a pair of Momcozy nursing bras — the Y21 Ultra Soft Nursing Bra, the YN46 Seamless Floral Push-up Nursing Bra — owned the top two spots in Amazon's category for Nursing Bras. Momcozy's bottle warmers also earned three of the top seven Prime Day Bottle Warmer spots, with the MW01 Fast Baby Bottle Warmer, the MW03 Portable Warmer For Travel and the 9-in-1 Nutrients Bottle Warmer with Night Light finishing among the category's hottest sellers. Other brand items to notch impressive sales figures during Amazon Prime Day included the Breastmilk Storage Bag, which ranked first on the list of best-selling Breastmilk Containers, and the U-Shaped Full-Body Maternity Pillow, which ranked second in the Pregnancy Pillow category. Momcozy's BS03 KleanPal Pro also finished ninth in the Bottle Washers category.

The global live streaming pay-per-view market reached a value of nearly $1.39 billion in 2023, having grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.42% since 2018. The market is expected to grow from $1.39 billion in 2023 to $3.11 billion in 2028 at a rate of 17.39%. The market is then expected to grow at a CAGR of 16.56% from 2028 and reach $6.69 billion in 2033. Growth in the historic period resulted from increased internet penetration, increased disposable income per capita, deployment of high-speed 5G networks, strong economic growth in emerging markets and increase in government support. Factors that negatively affected growth in the historic period were stringent regulations. Going forward, growth of subscription-based streaming services, increasing demand for live educational content and online courses, the rise in adoption of mobile devices and smart TVs and increasing sports audience will drive the market. Factors that could hinder the growth of the live streaming pay-per-view market in the future include high licensing fees and content acquisition costs.",GlobeNewsWire,"Mon, 10 Jun 2024 08:20:00 -0400",['PressRelease'],Neutral,Article,['AMZN']
